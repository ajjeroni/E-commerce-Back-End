# E-commerce-Back-End

## Description

For this task, students had to develop a node application that uses sequalize to create a mysql database and run routes to get, post, put and delete data for a ecommerce database.

This application was straightforward, being familiar with express.js the only difficult part was creating tables that used data from other tables using js.
## Usage

run "npm i"

Log into mysql 

run "source schema.sql" in the db folder

quit mysql

run "npm run seed"

run "npm run watch"

open insomnia and run routes as desired
